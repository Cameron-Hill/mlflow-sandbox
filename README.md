## What is this?

Nothing, really. just messing around with mlflow and github is the most convenient way to move stuff from my desktop to my laptop.

Most of this is coming from the mlflow quickstart guide. You can find this [here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/getting-started/intro-quickstart/index.html).
